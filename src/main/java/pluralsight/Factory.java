//AND ABSTRACT FACTORY
public class Factory {
    /*
     a factory does not expose instantiation logic to your client
     it defers to subclasses
     it has a common interface
     it is specified by architecture, implemented by the user of that framework
     factory methods can have instances and elements
     for example the calendar is used by the factory
     basically a factory is always doing OOP
     some pit falls. it is very long and just creates complication due to it being a long process
     Singleton and a factory are complete oposites
     a factory can return multiple instances
     A factory is parameter driven
     solves complex creation
     it is the opposite of a singleton

     Abstract factory
     is implemented with the factory
     and adds one more layer of security basically
     hides the factory
     doesnt have to be implemented with factory but either ways it will be 90% of the time no matter what
